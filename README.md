# Please Read This If You Are Hiring

Be aware that essentially none of my professional software contributions are documented here: I have previously worked in high-security environments (pharmacy and fraud investigation) that either did not permit me to track my changes using a personal GH account or else used some other form of internal source control.

Feel free to check out my old student projects or the small modern portfolio I am building (particularly the adventure game "Into the Dreamlands" and the Rails/React personal site "Lion's Paw Games"), but be aware that I also have a large body of Ruby on Rails and AWS expertise that is not captured by the projects publically available here.
